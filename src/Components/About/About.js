                    I've always had a passion for building and creating things. After
                    graduating a Computer science course for Hardware and Networking I
                    took those skills and worked in the industry for years when I wanted
                    to take it to the next level and learn the software side. I took a
                    thirteen week bootcamp course for web development.
